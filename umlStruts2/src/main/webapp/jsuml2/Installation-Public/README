IMPORTANT NOTE (from the authors):
----------------------------------
Notice that we freely but gladly share our effort with you, so please send us any modification or addition to the library code. We would also appreciate if you report any tool or website that you made using this library (or part of it). This will cost you only a very short time, but would help us to exchange our experiences and improve our library in the future. 
Enjoy the library! 


NOTES ON THE DISTRIBUTION
-------------------------
- The jsUML2 library is provided without any additional support.
- The editor is just a demo application. UML constraints and semantics are not implemented (it would depend on the programmer and the specific domain under construction). It can be used for you to learn about what jsUML2 can do. Look at the programmer's guide and code for further details and additional features.

INSTALATION
-----------
If you want to build the code, you may need the following tools:

-SPROCKETIZE-
This tool serves to solve the existing dependences among the different javascript files.

Sprocketize can be reached from 
http://getsprockets.org

Run the following command to download:
"gem --install remote sprockets"

Notice that Gem Ruby needs to be installed.


-YUI COMPRESSOR-
Yui Compressor is a tool from the Yahoo Javascript API that help us to compress the 
javascript code and, in consequence, it can significantly reduce the size of these files.

Further information about Yui Compressor is available from  
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/

or can be downloaded at
http://yuilibrary.com/downloads/#yuicompressor

YUICompressor 2.4.2 is included in this package, named yuicompressor.jar. All you need to 
run it is to ensure that the Java VM (JRE) is properly installed in your system.

After compressing the code, please notice that we provide this software according to the 
GPL3 license, i.e. you are requested to include the following code at the beginning of 
every file:

All the compression process can be automatically done by running the following script:
./make.sh
